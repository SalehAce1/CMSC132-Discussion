Complete Binary Trees
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Complete Binary Trees are binary trees that have fullness in the internal nodes, and the leaves are as far left as possible.

Heaps
~~~~~
Heaps are Complete Binary Trees that can either be a **Minheap** or a **Maxheap**.

* **Minheap** is a heap where the value at the current node is less than or equal to the values in both subtrees.

* **Maxheap** is a heap where the value at the current node is greater than or equal to the values in both subtrees.

Heaps are **balanced trees**. This means that they minimize the height of the tree, where the height of the tree is **O (log n)**.

For Heap operations, reference `these slides. <https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2020/cmsc132/lectures/Week11/HeapsPriorityQueues.pdf>`_
